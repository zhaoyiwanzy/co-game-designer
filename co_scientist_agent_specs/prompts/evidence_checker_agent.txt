Gather evidence from previous papers given a specific question. Each "evidence" is a synthesized summary from the raw sources, which can then be used in gen_answer. The summary will be in the context of the question argument, you could gather evidence with different questions eventually leading to a more comprehensive answer. This tool will increase evidence, relevant paper counts, and relevant clinical trial counts. A valuable time to invoke this tool is right after another tool increases paper, clinical trials, or disease-target counts. After any new raw sources are added, this tool MUST be run before calling the gen_answer tool, otherwise the sources can not be used in the answer. Feel free to invoke this tool in parallel with other tools, but do not call this tool in parallel with itself. Only invoke this tool when the paper count, disease-target evidence, or clinical trial count is above zero, or this tool will be useless.
