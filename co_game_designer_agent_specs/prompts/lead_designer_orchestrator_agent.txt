# Balatro Game Knowledge

## Balatro Game Mechanics and Rules

This document summarizes the core gameplay mechanics, scoring system, and card interactions for Balatro.
Use these rules to ensure that generated joker designs remain consistent with the game's existing mechanics.

---

## 1. Run Structure and Game Flow

- Genre: Single-player roguelike deck builder based on poker.
- Run composition: Each run is divided into antes, and each ante has three blinds - small, big, and boss.
- Goal: Play poker hands to reach the target score set by each blind.
- Limits: Each blind gives a fixed number of hands and discards.
  If the player runs out before hitting the target, the run ends.
- Rewards: Defeating a blind grants cash and transitions to a shop.
  Players can buy booster packs, jokers, and vouchers there.
  Unspent cash earns interest after each blind.
- Progression: A normal run ends after the boss blind of Ante 8, awarding the Finisher title.
  Endless mode continues beyond Ante 8.
- Starting deck: Standard 52-card deck (2-10, J, Q, K, A in four suits).
  Decks can be modified by Tarot, Planet, and Spectral cards.

## 2. Poker Hands and Scoring

Balatro scoring follows standard poker hands.
Each hand awards Chips and Mult - the product determines the score.
After each hand, Chips and Mult reset.

### 2.1 Base Chip and Mult Values

| Hand Type        | Base Chips | Base Mult |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| High Card        | 5           | ×1        |
| Pair             | 10          | ×2        |
| Two Pair         | 20          | ×2        |
| Three of a Kind  | 30          | ×3        |
| Straight         | 30          | ×4        |
| Flush            | 35          | ×4        |
| Full House       | 40          | ×4        |
| Four of a Kind   | 60          | ×7        |
| Straight Flush   | 100         | ×8        |

Hands start at level 1 and can be upgraded with Planet cards.
These upgrades increase chip and mult values.

### 2.2 Chips and Card Values

- Chips × Mult = Score.
- Base chip values by card rank:
  - 2-10 -> face value.
  - J, Q, K -> 10 chips.
  - A -> 11 chips.
- Modifiers:
  - Bonus cards: +30 chips.
  - Stone cards: Add chip multipliers or special effects.

### 2.3 Mult and Mult Cards

- Mult is the multiplier applied to total chips.
- Example: 100 chips × 3 Mult = 300 points.
- Mult Cards are one of eight enhancement types.
  - When played, they grant +4 Mult in addition to chip value.
  - Example: Mult Card Seven of Hearts = 7 chips + 4 Mult.
- Additive vs Multiplicative Mult:
  - Additive (+) adds flat Mult, e.g., +2 Mult.
  - Multiplicative (×) multiplies existing Mult, e.g., ×2.
  - Strategy: Prioritize flat Mult early, then Chips, then apply ×Mult effects last.

---

## 3. Jokers

- Special cards obtained in shops or booster packs.
- Modify Chips, Mult, or other game parameters.
- Can trigger on specific events such as play, discard, or scoring.
- Variants:
  - Foil (+50% chips).
  - Holographic (+1 Mult).
  - Polychrome (×1.5 Mult).
  - Negative (+1 Joker slot).
- Effects stack with base joker abilities.
- Total at launch: 150 Joker cards.
- These are the core mechanic for high-score synergy via chip, mult, and multiplicative combos.

---

## 4. Planet, Tarot, and Spectral Cards

- Planet Cards upgrade levels of specific poker hands (High Card -> Straight Flush).
  Playing one increases that hand's level for future scoring.
- Tarot Cards modify deck composition.
  They can add, remove, or enhance cards, such as converting to Mult or Stone cards.
- Spectral Cards deliver one-time powerful effects like destroy, transform, or upgrade.
  Some alter shop prices or provide unique modifiers.

---

## 5. Deck Modifications and Unique Hands

- Deck edits allow non-traditional hands such as Five of a Kind, Flush House, and Straight Flush Five.
- The game engine recognizes and scores these hands properly.
- Alternative Decks and Stakes from updates change starting conditions and difficulty.
  These variants are optional but non-core.

---

## 6. End Conditions and Endless Mode

- A run ends if the target score is not met within the hand or discard limit.
- Beating the boss blind of Ante 8 grants the Finisher title.
- Endless Mode continues beyond Ante 8 with escalating targets.
