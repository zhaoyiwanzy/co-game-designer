Run Structure and Game Flow\n\n- Genre: Single-player roguelike deck builder based on poker.\n- Run composition: Each run is divided into antes, and each ante has three blinds - small, big, and boss.\n- Goal: Play poker hands to reach the target score set by each blind.\n- Limits: Each blind gives a fixed number of hands and discards.\n  If the player runs out before hitting the target, the run ends.\n- Rewards: Defeating a blind grants cash and transitions to a shop.\n  Players can buy booster packs, jokers, and vouchers there.\n  Unspent cash earns interest after each blind.\n- Progression: A normal run ends after the boss blind of Ante 8, awarding the Finisher title.\n  Endless mode continues beyond Ante 8.\n- Starting deck: Standard 52-card deck (2-10, J, Q, K, A in four suits).\n  Decks can be modified by Tarot, Planet, and Spectral cards.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Poker Hands and Scoring\n\nBalatro scoring follows standard poker hands.\nEach hand awards Chips and Mult - the product determines the score.\nAfter each hand, Chips and Mult reset.\n\n### 2.1 Base Chip and Mult Values\n\n| Hand Type        | Base Chips | Base Mult |\n|------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| High Card        | 5           | \u00d71        |\n| Pair             | 10          | \u00d72        |\n| Two Pair         | 20          | \u00d72        |\n| Three of a Kind  | 30          | \u00d73        |\n| Straight         | 30          | \u00d74        |\n| Flush            | 35          | \u00d74        |\n| Full House       | 40          | \u00d74        |\n| Four of a Kind   | 60          | \u00d77        |\n| Straight Flush   | 100         | \u00d78        |\n\nHands start at level 1 and can be upgraded with Planet cards.\nThese upgrades increase chip and mult values.\n\n### 2.2 Chips and Card Values\n\n- Chips \u00d7 Mult = Score.\n- Base chip values by card rank:\n  - 2-10 -> face value.\n  - J, Q, K -> 10 chips.\n  - A -> 11 chips.\n- Modifiers:\n  - Bonus cards: +30 chips.\n  - Stone cards: Add chip multipliers or special effects.\n\n### 2.3 Mult and Mult Cards\n\n- Mult is the multiplier applied to total chips.\n- Example: 100 chips \u00d7 3 Mult = 300 points.\n- Mult Cards are one of eight enhancement types.\n  - When played, they grant +4 Mult in addition to chip value.\n  - Example: Mult Card Seven of Hearts = 7 chips + 4 Mult.\n- Additive vs Multiplicative Mult:\n  - Additive (+) adds flat Mult, e.g., +2 Mult.\n  - Multiplicative (\u00d7) multiplies existing Mult, e.g., \u00d72.\n  - Strategy: Prioritize flat Mult early, then Chips, then apply \u00d7Mult effects last.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Jokers\n\n- Special cards obtained in shops or booster packs.\n- Modify Chips, Mult, or other game parameters.\n- Can trigger on specific events such as play, discard, or scoring.\n- Variants:\n  - Foil (+50% chips).\n  - Holographic (+1 Mult).\n  - Polychrome (\u00d71.5 Mult).\n  - Negative (+1 Joker slot).\n- Effects stack with base joker abilities.\n- Total at launch: 150 Joker cards.\n- These are the core mechanic for high-score synergy via chip, mult, and multiplicative combos.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Planet, Tarot, and Spectral Cards\n\n- Planet Cards upgrade levels of specific poker hands (High Card -> Straight Flush).\n  Playing one increases that hand's level for future scoring.\n- Tarot Cards modify deck composition.\n  They can add, remove, or enhance cards, such as converting to Mult or Stone cards.\n- Spectral Cards deliver one-time powerful effects like destroy, transform, or upgrade.\n  Some alter shop prices or provide unique modifiers.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Deck Modifications and Unique Hands\n\n- Deck edits allow non-traditional hands such as Five of a Kind, Flush House, and Straight Flush Five.\n- The game engine recognizes and scores these hands properly.\n- Alternative Decks and Stakes from updates change starting conditions and difficulty.\n  These variants are optional but non-core.\n\n---\n\n## 6. End Conditions and Endless Mode\n\n- A run ends if the target score is not met within the hand or discard limit.\n- Beating the boss blind of Ante 8 grants the Finisher title.\n- Endless Mode continues beyond Ante 8 with escalating targets.",
